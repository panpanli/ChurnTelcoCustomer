# ChurnTelcoCustomer
The dataset contains Telco Customer Churn information.
-- customers demographic information (gender, etc.), 
-- service info: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
-- account info: tenure, contract type, payment type, monthly charges 
Using the information above, a model can be used to explain customer churn behavior to better design strategy.

In the project, EDA is conducted, and decision tree model is used to explain customer churn behavior. Based on the my DT model results, it shows that contract type, tenure, internet service type, monthly charges are the important variables.
